# Initializing Memory Banks

```
> Loading childhood.dll...
> Parsing nostalgia.bin...
> WARNING: Segmentation fault detected
```

## The Beginning

Every journey starts somewhere. Mine started with a blinking cursor on a black screen, waiting for input.

### First Steps

I remember the first time I wrote `Hello, World!` - it felt like magic. A simple string of characters that somehow made the machine speak.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Patience** - Debugging teaches you patience like nothing else
2. **Curiosity** - Always ask "why does this work?"
3. **Persistence** - The bug is always in the last place you look

## Looking Forward

The journey continues. Each line of code is a step forward, each bug a lesson learned.
