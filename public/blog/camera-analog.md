## Why Film?

In an age of instant gratification, there's something magical about waiting for film to develop. Each frame is precious, each shot intentional.

### The Process

1. Load the film
2. Set your exposure
3. Compose your shot
4. Press the shutter
5. **Wait**

## The Waiting Game

Unlike digital, you can't chimp. You take the shot and trust your instincts. The anticipation of picking up developed film is unmatched.

## Gear

- **Camera**: Canon AE-1 Program
- **Lens**: 50mm f/1.4
- **Film**: Kodak Portra 400
